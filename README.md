## cOdE wIzArD by Day, Problem Solver by Night

Welcome to a corner of GitHub. It’s cozy, efficient, and has just the right amount of self-satisfaction. If you’ve stumbled here, you probably want to know what makes me *tick* (= clean code, scalable architectures, and the joy of solving "impossible" problems).

## Some of What I Do (And Do Well)

- Languages I speak: C, C++, C#, English, Java, JavaScript, Macedonian, TypeScript, Python, Kotlin, R, and even some German.
- Write software for bionic arms at [eBionyx](https://ebionyx.com).
- Make programs generate [crosswords](https://github.com/teokitan/krstozbor) for me.
- Brag about the time I went to the world's most prestigious [computer science competition](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/7176).

## Who Thinks I Know What I’m Doing?
